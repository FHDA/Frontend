            "Admission to the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at UCLA is highly competitive. The most important selection criteria are completion of the required preparatory courses and academic performance. Listed below are the lower division preparation courses for the major. All applicants must have a minimum transferable cumulative GPA of 3.4. Preparatory courses must be completed by the end of spring prior to fall enrollment. All major courses must be taken for a letter grade. HSSEAS admits students by major and does NOT consider applicants for alternate majors. Applicants are not required to complete the HSSEAS General Education Requirements in order to be admitted, although it is beneficial for students to complete 1 course from each of the following areas: arts, humanities, social sciences, and life sciences. Applicants can fulfill the lower division General Education requirement by completion of the Intersegmental General Transfer Curriculum (IGETC). Partial IGETC is NOT accepted. For more information regarding this major and UCLA's transfer selection process, visit www.admission.ucla.edu. If you still have specific questions, you may email the HSSEAS admissions office at erkki@seas.ucla.edu.  PLEASE NOTE: the community college courses listed below have been approved to satisfy the preparation requirements for this major at UCLA, but they may not be exact equivalents of the UCLA courses listed. In addition, upper division requirements for the major may be satisfied by lower division community college course(s) listed below, however specific credit will be determined by the department after transfer.",
